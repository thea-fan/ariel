Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--"Scout"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her.

He initially attributes these episodes to the stress of his job, but as these symptoms worsen, he agrees to see a neurologist and is handed a diagnosis that will change his and his family’s lives forever: Huntington’s Disease. Huntington’s is a lethal neurodegenerative disease with no treatment and no cure.

If anything, I would try to read it as a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird and view it as an interesting insight into Lees development of her beloved, world-famous question. With that in mind, I wasnt really disappointed in this question. I liked it. Its just that, essentially, its a weaker version of To Kill a Mockingbird.');
